# A Tool for Morphological Inflection

This is the code accompanying our paper on "Pushing the Limits of Low-Resource Morphological Inflection".

# Requirements

Are listed in `requirements.txt` so you can just run
~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

# Hallucinating data

Use the `augment.py` script as follows:
~~~
python augment.py [data_directory] [language] --examples N [--use_dev]
~~~

The script assumes data in the format of the [https://sigmorphon.github.io/sharedtasks/2019/task1/](SIGMORPHON 2019 task 1 inflection shared task) (e.g. from Asturian):
~~~
meyorar	meyorar√≠a	V;1;SG;COND
firir	firir	V;NFIN
algamar	algamareis	V;2;PL;SBJV;PST;IPFV;LGSPEC1
...
~~~
but assumes that files named `language-train`, `language-dev`, and `language-test` are under `data_directory`.
